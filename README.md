# Roblox-group-finder

(fixed main.py, had a syntax error) 

A tool to help you find ownerless roblox groups

Edit channel -> Integrations -> Webhooks
paste it where it says "paste your Webhook" 

- It will not send locked groups or already owned groups (obviously) 
- On Line 13 of Main.py Change range of groups to scan. example: (15000000, 30000000)
- i think max threads are like 2k, then u get rate limited all the time
- updating weekly
